# Sudoku_Solver

## Introduction
This project is a basic sudoku solver written in python. It prints results to the command line. It takes as an input a .txt file that represents a sudoku where all the blank spaces are replaced with 0's.  See an example below:

```
200080040
000309007
090002005
050400800
806000401
003001050
600500010
900703000
080010003
```

## Instructions
To run the program use this command:

```
python sudoku.py practice_sudoku/practice.txt
```

You can run the four examples included in the practice_sudoku directory by changing the .txt file name in the command.  You can also add your own sudoku example.

## Code Base
sudoku.py - holds all the logic for the solver and prints result to the command line

/practice_sudoku - a directory that holds many example sudoku that are in .txt format
